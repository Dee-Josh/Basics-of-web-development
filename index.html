                    <p>
                        The phrase "web development" refers broadly to anything involved in creating a website. It includes all related development responsibilities, including markup, coding, scripting, network setting, CMS, and eCommerce development. Web development is responsible for everything that is available to you in your browser.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Web Fundamentals</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        Before you can create a straightforward blog or a company website, you must comprehend how websites function. A website is essentially a collection of files kept on a server that are viewed by clients using browsers like Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. You should be able to distinguish between the two major concepts used here: server and client.

                    <h2>Main Divisions of Web Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        Front end development and back end development are the two main divisions in web development based on the client-server interaction. The user interface, or what you see on the browser when using the Internet, is the focus of front end or client-side development. The focus of back-end or server-side programming is on background operations. The back end of a website seems to non-developers as a random collection of letters, numbers, and symbols, but it really houses the digital infrastructure that keeps a website functioning properly.
                        
                        The front end of your website would be the storefront and product display section if it were a physical business, where customers could see the items and make purchases. The stock room and back office, where goods are transported, kept, and inventoried, would be considered the back end.

                    <p>
                        Web developers utilize a code editor as a tool to write and edit code. It is a crucial tool for creating websites since it includes specific features that make editing code easier. An integrated development environment (IDE), which integrates many development tools to make coding more easier, is a more sophisticated and reliable tool.
                        
                        These days, Visual Studio, Atom, Sublime Text, and Vim are the most popular code editors. Check out VS Code, a simplified version of Microsoft's primary IDE, Visual Studio, if you're a newbie. Beginners will love VS Code since it is simple to use and offers features that can be customized.

                        The words front end, client-side, and user-facing are the most frequently used to describe front end development. This kind of web development focuses on a website's layout, navigation, and text and graphic content. The primary objective of a front end developer is to design and create user interfaces that support the objectives of their clients.

                            <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the primary file format loaded in browsers and is the basis for all webpages. No matter how basic or sophisticated the website is, it defines the structure. To specify how text, pictures, and other information should be presented, tags are used. A straightforward static website may be produced using only HTML.</p>

                                The usage of software (packages) can be automated with the use of package managers. They assist you with setting up, removing, upgrading, or configuring software for your web development endeavors. In addition, they can get software from repositories. Node Package Manager (NPM), Advanced Packaging Tool (APT), and Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) are three of the most used package managers.

                                The process of creating and operating software is automated by build tools. They are employed to convert development source code into production code for programs that may be executed. They also perform other helpful tasks such as compiling Sass files, transpiling JavaScript files, and running a local web server. Webpack, Gulp, and Parcel are the build tools that developers most often use. Because it comes pre-configured, Gulp is a good option for beginners.

                                Software code changes are managed and tracked via a system called version control, sometimes known as source control. It keeps track of every change you make to the code so that you can quickly go back to earlier iterations if something goes wrong. Additionally, it improves developer cooperation on the same project. Git is still the most popular version control system in use today. Git repositories are often kept on GitHub by developers.
